     THIS HOTEL IS LOCATED AT 63RD AND BROADWAY. WALKING DISTANCE FROM BROADWAY SHOWS, TIME SQUARE, LINCOLN CENTER, CENTRAL PARK AND SO MANY OTHER MAJOR MUST SEE OPPORTUNITIES. SUBWAY AND BUS TRANSIT ARE ONE BLOCK AWAY, SO YOU CAN GET TO ANY PLACE YOU WANT TO GO WITH EASE. ALL THIS WITHOUT THE NOISE OF THE CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS. I WILL STAY HERE AGAIN AND AGAIN.

      one of the very best locations in Manhatten for sure! nicely refurbished rooms, cleanliness wonderful, attracting rates, compare to other "insane" ones in neighboring hotels
I loved the ambiance, the courtesy of the staff (especially after reading so many discouraging comments saying the opposite) everyone was a great help
it seems rather inconvenient that hotel doesn't provide free wifi in the rooms, only in the lobby. Plus, a very bothering payment for this!!!!
the best location in NYC!</blockquote>

   Most inexpensive NYC hotels have postage-stamp-sized rooms, not this one. The Empire could not be at a better location: beautiful view of Lincoln Center right out the door, surrounded by great restaurants, subway a short walk, plenty of cabs, Columbus Circle and the park just down the block. Everything had been updated since I stayed there years ago. Lobby was a nice scene as was the convenient bar with ballgames on. Didn't make it to rooftop bar, but if I'd stayed longer would have checked it out.

 The Empire is a special New York Experience. Steps from Lincoln Center, the rooftop bar (on opposite ends of a great indoor nat, allows you to see so much of New York, the River and the skyline. The Eastside roof space basks in the glow of the iconic Hotel Empire neon sign and is a great place for drinks with friends or a date. The lobby bar is a nice touch and the oyster happy hour at Ed's Chowder House is true treasure at an amazing price. The rooms are wll appointed and the location amazing. Great price, great lace!!
