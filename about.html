    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>From conception to  completion, The Empire Hotel and Country Club was an ambitious project,  employing over 300 highly skilled designers, technicians and craftsmen  throughout its six-year construction. Since it opened on 16 October 2000, The  Empire has become synonymous with Brunei: reflecting the country's majestic and  cultural heritage.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Today, The Empire  Hotel and Country Club is managed by a highly experienced team of dedicated  professionals. Supported by the wisdom of a mainly Bruneian Board of Directors,  they inspire more than 800 employees to uphold the special characteristics that  have become recognised as being unique to The Empire.</p>
